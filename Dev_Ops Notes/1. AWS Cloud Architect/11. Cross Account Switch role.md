## intro
- org has multiple projects going on simultaneously and each project has their seperate infra and seperate teams working for them
- every team are responsible for doing 
	- infra hosting
	- infra creating
	- infra manage
	- cost management
	- resource management
	- security maintaining
	- monitoring
- lets say all team members on on project are on leave. and there is an urgent need for a work to complete[on s3, or on routing etc] 
- at that time there are other team employees are available for the work
- so we create a switch access role policy so that he stays in his aws account only but can switch to the othe raccount and finish he work
- there are multiple ways to do it
	- 1. give him root access[email and pswd]
	- 2. creating a IAM user
	- 3. Cross account access[organizational]
		- ssm works
		- cost mgmt works
		- billing
		- security hub works......................................[research]

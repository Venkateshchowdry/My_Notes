### Management 
- ## Resource management
		- suppose we created 6 s3 but only 4 are using then delete the other s3

- ## Cost management
		- find ways how to reduce the operational costs-like suppose we give 40 gb for database but only 35 gb is using so delete extra gb
- ### 1. Cost explorer [use cases]
	- enable it it takes 24 hours to display the costs occured to your account
	- charge type : exclude credits[if u have some]
	- group by services/regions/time  so many filters then go the specific region and service delete them
- ### 2. Resource groups and Tag Editor
	- -->tag editor [we use tags when creating resources to link one another]
	- -->select all regions-->all resources
	- we will get a ton of resources in our aws 
	- mix and match regions and services found them and delete them
- ### 3. using ssm automation documet to delete all resources
	- check the billing like we do
	- AWSSupport-ListEC2Resources AWS SSMAutomation document to list actice ec2 resources[all like EBS, EC2, ASG EIP's]
	- by default it gathers all region data
	- -->to run the docu,emt
	- -->open SSM
	- -->select automation [under change management]
	- -->search automation document of [AWSSupport-ListEC2Resources]
	- -->next
	- -->select simple execution
	- -->wait untill it checks
	- -->outputs tab-->u will have list of all resources 
	- -->go to specific resources and delete the resources
	[different automation documents for differnt resources]
	
	

- ## Monitoring- AWS Cloud watch
	- always monitoring whats is happening in our aws account

- ## Security - aws security hub service
	- we have to enable security hub service- once u enable it
		- it [will scan all the infra and find any vulnerabilities/threats]. if it found any[ it will displays in dedicated dash boards] like problems in vpc, s3 , ALB etcc
		- go to that problem and on top u will find instruction to resolve them-->remedies and instruction--> follow to resolve the issues
		- automatically your security score will improve[>=70 best score]
		- default security score is 30% [when infra deployed]
	- ### pre requisite to security hub
	- in addition to that we have to enable some other services as a [prerequisite services to security hub]- if you dont enable them you will not find any threats-independent dedicated tools
		-  1. [amazon inspector]
			- checks the faults in infra
			- like some one entered in to web server with out vpn
			- if DB ip is public then it shows error
		- 2. [IAM access analyzer]
			- detects threats to roles, iam users etc
		- 3. [Amazo guard duty]
			- incoming/outgoing traffic, how services working
		- 4.[ aws config]
			- find threats reagarding acc configurations
			- -->next -->next -->enable
			- [read the options and proceed]
	- [always enable these four and security hub] //so that u can view these dashboards in security hub

## Security hub
- -->go to security hub-->enable
- it will shows the passed and failed [we have to resolve according to it]
- -->view all standards
- we will get two options
	- 1. AWS foundational security best practices 
		- issues related to IAm
	- 2. CIS AWS Foundational Benchmark
		- all other issues like vpc pairing, SG issues, DB ip public etcc
- [it will take 2 hours to check and show threats]

## Cloud watch
- some times many metrics are not available so companies use third party tools
- griffana, prometricss, diatres, splunk integrate with AWS and moniter from there
- -->create dashboard
- simply sit and watch the process. when problem araise mail respective team to resolve 
- if server problem call admin team
- -->all alarms-->create dedicated alarm service 
- [alredy done in the infra creation see 12]

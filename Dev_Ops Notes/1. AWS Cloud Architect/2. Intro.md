## Brief 
We can deploy application in cloud in different ways
1. manual deployment using scp cmds
2. By using Deployment tools like jenkins, circle CI, Big Bucket.....
## Jenkins
CICD-checks all the integrations if every thing is ok then it allows for deployment
- we creat pipelines
	- pipeline to check git hub integration
	- sonarqube/ selenium testing check pipeline
- then using plugins it will get deployed in the cloud(aws/azure/Gcp)
- it has an option called 'BUILD' some times we cannot understand error in build so we use MAVEN

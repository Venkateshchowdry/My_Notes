## Lect 9
## Background
- lets say natasha has a local boutique and wants to sell online. so she she purchased a domain name in [godaddy.com] and wants to dispaly static content [not dynamic content]  
- for static website we usually create s3 and host it there[bucket public , obj public, url public]
- so site got hosted and natasha used amrketting using facebook and instagram and run smoothly
- lets say site hosted in india so if user click the site name mapped to the bucket. it takes 1 seconds to access it
- but to access from US it takes more time  [more latency]
- so use Cloud front
## Cloud Front-aws
- store your site in amazon edge locations[to achieve low latency] no need to come to origin every time 
- in azure we call it as CDN
- cloud front can be mapped to s3 or can be mapped to ec2 that hosts the static website

- we can also crate cloud front and attatch it to load balancer and map this load balancer to the server

## Redis - Elastic cache-DB buffer management
- for better management of the data base
- lets say same data is requested by multiple users again and again. it will be a security threat to the db . so we use Redis
- Redis acts as a elastic cache between webserver and the database
- store the freequently access data from database and sends that data to user without reaching up to data base- so db is more secure and no burden/load on the database up to 15 days

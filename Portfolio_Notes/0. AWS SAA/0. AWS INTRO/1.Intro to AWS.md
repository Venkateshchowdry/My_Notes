# Intro to AWS

## Region
- Each region has many AZ **(Cluster of Availability Zones)** (usually 3, min 2, max 6) within a geographic region
- Ex: `us-east-1`, `ap-south-1`
- Consideration when selecting a region
    - Compliance (some countries require the data to be present in a data centre present in that country by law)
    - Proximity to customers: reduced latency
    - Available services within a Region: new services and new features aren’t available in every Region
    - Pricing: pricing varies region to region and is transparent in the service pricing page

## Availability Zone (AZ)
-   Each AZ is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity
- Ex: `us-east-1a`, `us-east-1b` & `us-east-1c`
-   AZs are separated from each other (isolated from disasters)
-   They’re connected with high bandwidth, ultra-low latency networking

> AZ name (eg. us-east-1a) is linked to an AWS account. **Same AZ name for two AWS accounts might not refer to the same physical AZ**. Use **AZ ID (unique ID for each AZ)** to coordinate AZ across accounts.

## Data centers
- 8 data centers for each AZ

## Point of Presence
- total 216 including 205 edge locations and 11 regional caches
- spreading across 84 cities and 42 countries

## 5 Characteristics of Cloud Computing
1. On- demand self service
2. broad network access
3. multi tenancy and resource pooling
4. rapid elasticity and scalability
5. measured service

## six advantages of cloud computing
- Trade capital expence for  operational expence
- benifits from massive economics of scale
- stop guessing capacity
- increase speed and agility
- stop spending money on data centers maintainance
- go global in minutes

## Types of cloud computing

## Lecture 1

In olden days lets suppose sbi want to make services online

To have a web service or application working we need

1.  Java developers
2.  Networking team
3.  Desktop support engineer
4.  System Admins
5.  Storage engineer
6.  Database team and many more……..
    
Consulting company(PWC, KPMG, E&Y, Deloitte, Accenture)will give 3 options

1.  They hire team for us
2.  We have to hire technical team
3.  Go to a Service based companies available in the market like (wipro, infosys, Hcl,Tcs, tech mahindra)

They hire a team and start developing

Once they develop the site they have to deploy it on the server (on prem). Usually linux server

-   Using SCP cmd: to copy files between a local and a remote or btween two remote systems- we get application to the onprem server
-   Fullfill all the dependencies and all the database and all then 
-   Assign a public ip and point it to a domain name(lets say sbi.com)
-   Physical load balancer to handle more requests
-   Client always demand
	-   Cost effective
	-   Time managing 
	-   On time delivery (all these together called AGILE methodology-client introduced this)
    
## Lecture 2

- NSIT in america developed GIT Hub (collaborative version control) 
- Selenium for testing and aws for infra hosting

## Jenkins: CICD- continue integration continue delivery
- if lets suppose u want to update your site in aws (like u want to put flag in your site) usually admin will down the website in midnight and do updates
- cons is you may be get an error or some thing so jenking came in to place (a place where you can test code before deploying in to aws infra) it is also called CICD-

## Agile Methodology
- code developing-build-test-deploy-repeat 
## Maven
- if there are many servers(lets say 50 ) its difficult to configure(every thing like adding users/ checking pswds) them manually so configuration management tools like ansible(remote control contains an inventory file YAML), puppet etc...to automate them
- create  yaml file and and define IP addresses of the Docker containers .............read about it

## Terraform
- To automate the process of creating infrastructures 
- 

## Monitoring tools
- promotheous
- #Grafana
- splunk
- dynatrace
- in AWS like Cloud watch. in cloud watch metrics is not available so we use third part tools like #Grafana
## Docker
-  to manage your unused machine space to run another applicaton- these are all microservices
## Kubernetees
- is a automation tool to manage this micro services like containerization.
## Dev Ops
- A single person to do all the above operations other than developing
- 2024 after going to be less demand
## Future Technologies
- Mlops
- Gitops
- Elasticops: deploy everything in microservices
- jenkins and kubernettes are also good

## Staic Website Hosting-Real Time
- every product/software developed by company will create 2 type of content
	- 1. staitc content [just blog ]
	- 2. Dynamic content [have to interact with database]
- company will host static content in two different ways
	- 1.  developed code pushed in to git hub and deploy[host it] in the ec2 instance [apache server]
	- 2. using s3 bucket-->made it public[mostly used]
	- [in azure s3 is called as blob storage]
- download some sample static website[usually developed by UI, Ux, front end developer code in css, html, jumla] from the internet
- ask developer directly upload code to s3[create iam role for developer-->give s3 permission-->give him credentials-->CLI configure in his local machine-->cmds to upload-->done ]
- [1. upload to s3 bucket
- 2. deploy from github if you are using ec2]

## 1. Using Ec2
### launch instance
- -->name : Static-website-server
- -->amazon linux2
- -->key pair-->create key pair-->static-key[a key gets downloaded]
- -->network settings-->edit-->select vpc-->default [will change according to company needs]
- -->subnet-->Us-east-1a[will change according to company needs]
- -->public ip -->enable
- -->security group-->type-->all traffic[will change according to company needs]
- -->done
### access this ec2 from cmd
- -->cd downloads
- -->ssh ec2-user@[publiv ip] -i static-key.pem
- -->sudo -i
- -->yes-->done
- [we need a webserver to run the site- 1. apache 2. tomcat]
### install apache
- -->yum install httpd -y
- -->systemctl start httpd
- -->systemctl enable httpd
- -->syatemctl restart httpd
- -->systemctl status httpd--> active running
- -->cd /var/www/html  - [path where we save the code same path for every server]
- -->ls
### upload website
- -->download sample website from the internet
- -->unzip it first
- there are [multiple ways to upload code to web server]
	- 1.  using git bash-->using scp command
	- 2. upload from cmd line
	- 3. clone from github[install git in the ec2-->login to git-->git pull/git clone]  [companies use this method]
	- 4. deploy from jenkins server
### 1. upload using scp cmd-git bash
- -->paste access key[static-key.pem] inside the website folder
- -->go to folder[inside] where code saved -->right click-->show more options-->git bash here
- -->scp -i static-key.pem * ec2-user@[static-server public ip] :
- -->you  will see code uploaded
### check the content on server
- -->go to cmd prompt
- -->exit[exit from root]
- -->ls[now you are at ec2 user]  [you will see the uploaded content]
- [we are getting error for the site we choose but try it with other website]
### 2. upload from cmd line-local method
- -->sudo -i
- -->cd /var/www/html
- -->ls
- -->rm -r [file name] // [if you have any files already in this path]
- -->wget [paste the link address] //*right click on the download button of the sample website *
- -->unzip lodge.zip
- -->ls
- -->cd lodge-html/
- -->ls
- [usually paste the content in /var/www/html folder] //here we have another folder in side the html folder ie on lodge-html
- -->[so copy code to var/www/html]
- -->cp -r * ./. [copy files to previous directory]
- -->cp -r * ../.. [copies files two directories back]
- -->cd ../..   [get back step of two directories]
- [learn cd commands for linux]
- //we got a problem files stored in www bit instead we need them in html folder
- -->cp * html/
- -->ls[ now we got every file copied in to the html path]
- // we dont need extra files like the lodge-html and lodge.zip inside the folder so delete them
- -->rm -rf lodge-html/ lodge.zip  //[deletes both the files]
- -->ls
### In company we add a folder in this path and do some process like
	- we have to give permission to folder
	- call the path,
	- vhost...................long process ................................ learn it  [important]
- -->systemctl restart httpd
- -->done
- -->go to aws console -->copy public ip-->paste it in web browser
- -->done
- now our site is unsecure
- to make it secure-->map it with domain-->get an ssl certificate and secure it 
#### Terminate the instance- costs may occur 

## 2. Using S3
### Create S3 bucket
- -->unique name: my-static-bucket-2098
- -->region: check
- -->create bucket
- two procedures to upload data
	- 1. create iam role for developer-->give s3 permission access -->you will get secret key (credentials)-->aws CLI configure in his local machine-->cmds to upload in to s3-->done 
	- 2. if code is in local machine-->click upload in aws console-->drag and drop-->
- [there are multiple ways to accelerate the uploading speed]

### Upload a static website-method 2-[organizational]
[for method 1 see 3.2]
- Download some static website-like personal blog from web
	- -->upload-->add files.
	- -->drag and drop files from the folder contains the code

- but here your bucket is private- u dont want to make it public bcoz of security-->but you want to access it so map it with cloud front-->get url to access content

### Create a cloud front- website hosting
- a service for global content delivery network
- -->cloud front-->create distribution
- -->origin domain-->select our s3 bucket name
- [we have to craete a policy here]
- -->origin access-->leagcy access identity OAI-//[since our content is static // there are 3 option. 1. public 2. OAC- for dynamic website content 3. OAI- for static content]
- -->create new OAI-->create // [automatically creates a new OAI ]
- -->yes update the bucket policy 
- -->price class //[where do you want your website visible]
- -->default root object-->index.html //[since our website is a html website-# research more for other type of websites we use more in organization]
- -->description-->my-static-distribution // [any name to remember]
- -->create distribution
### view website
- -->copy distribution domain name -->paste in new tab-->done
- -->successor 

- -->[in organizations we get ssl certificate for our website and map it to domain name ]

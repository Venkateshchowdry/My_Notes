- lets say our source code is in some SCM[source code management tool]  [git/bitbucket] here we assume our code is in bit bucket
### Code deploy agent
- [to tell servers that which code to be deploy]
- we can do it two different ways
### method-1
-  best practice is when we are creating launch configuration -->select user data -->we can store the code deploy agent 
- [since we are creating two instances at a time its better to use this data in the user data of the launch configuration]
### method-2 [manual]
#### Access Private web server from local machine with VPN
- cmd
- -->cd Downloads
- -->ssh ec2-user@[private ip] -i venkat.pem  //[private ip of webserver]
- -->yes
- -->sudo -i //[now you are at root of webserver]
- //[here we install code deploy agent]
- -->yum update -y 
- [//google code deploy agent installation-->select through cmd line option-->for amazon linux machine
- // you will get all the dependencies and procedure to follow]
#### install code deploy agent
- -->yum install ruby -y
- -->yum install wget -y
- -->sudo yum install wget -y
- -->#!/bin/bash
CODEDEPLOY_BIN="/opt/codedeploy-agent/bin/codedeploy-agent"
$CODEDEPLOY_BIN stop
yum erase codedeploy-agent -y
- -->cd /home/ec2-user
- -->wget https://bucket-name.s3.region-identifier.amazonaws.com/latest/install
- -->[wget https://aws-codedeploy-us-east-1.s3.amazonaws.com/latest/install]
- // this code works to install [do research]
- -->chmod +x ./install
- -->sudo ./install auto
- -->sudo service codedeploy-agent status[to check status]
- -->success
[now comes the deployment]
### bit bucket - setup[automation document]
- lets say developer pushes the code into bit bucket in a repository[contains all the code]
- we just have to make folder [name : script] in that folder we will define how this code to be deployed in server[running code pipelines]
- [what ever the repository process is same]
- go to settings and select repository variables and add variables
- we have to define the values
	- where to deploy the code
	- s3-->where to backup the code
	- on which region should we deploy the code 
	- on which account should we deploy the code
- in our case we have to add
	- s3
	- deployment group service name[code will come here and deploy from here]
	- deployment configuration typre -->code deploy default one at a time
	- \
- -->go to bitbucket site 
- -->select our repository
- -->repository settings
- -->repository variables-->change environment variables
- // follow document create a s3 : sbi-code-deploy-8145 
- //create code deploy
- ### code deploy
	- -->applications-->create application-->name : SBI
	- compute platform : ec2/on-premisis-->create-->done
	- -->deployment groups-->create deployment groups
	- -->name : SBI-DG   [deployment group name]
	- -->service role : RoleforcodedeploySBI
	- -->deploymwnt type : in place
	- -->environment configuration : amazon ec2 auto scaling groups
	- -->select our ASG : SBI-ASG
	- -->deployment settings : CodeDeployDefault.OneAtATime [imp]
	- -->Choose tg :SBI-TG
	- -->done
-  -->s3 name : sbi-code-deploy-8145 // [for now i am not getting repository variables option in bit bucket  send a mail to bit bucket]
-  -->deployment group name : SBI-DG
- -->deployment config : codedeploydefault.oneatatime
- -->application name : SBI
- -->access key: 
- -->security key id:                          //create new access key credentials and paste them here.
- -->done
- [we can add another row and make them more secure ]

to check the website
- -->copy server public ip or ALB DNs copy and paste in browser
- -->site live
- -->other way is acess server through vpn and access site

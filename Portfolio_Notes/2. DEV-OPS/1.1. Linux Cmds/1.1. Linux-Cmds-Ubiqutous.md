- -->date
- -->echo "hello venkatesh" [print statement]
	- echo "this is a dragon bird: Dracarys" > [filename]
		- this will write the statement inside the file
- -->mkdir learnlinux [creates a new folder]
- -->mkdir test2 && cd test2 [ create and go to the new folder at same time]
- -->cd learnlinux/[change directory]
- -->touch 1.txt [creates a 1.txt]
- -->touch file(1..5).txt  [creates 5 .txt files like file1.txt, file2.txt, file3.txt...... ]
- -->ls    [display list]
- -->rm file*
- - -->nano 2.txt [it will automatically create and allow us to edit the file]

- -->rm [path]
- -->rmdir test2/
- -->rm -r test2/ [remove recurssively all the non visible elements inside the diectory and delete the directory as well]
- -->mkdir test1 [we are creating a directory inside a learnlinux directory]
- //we will observe a clour change between files and directory
### list
- -->ls -l [displays folder content with permissions]
- -->ls -la[file full details with permissions]
- -->ls test1/ [displays the files in test1 folder another way]
- -->ls [path] // displays the files in the path
- -->ls ~/app/   [displays the file in the specified path]

### Move
- it also used as rename for the folder name since we move the whole content into another folder
- -->mv [source folder/file path]  [destination folder/path]
- -->mv 1.txt test1/ [move 1.txt file from learnlinux to test1 folder]

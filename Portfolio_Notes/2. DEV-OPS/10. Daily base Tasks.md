- running automate scripts to check the disk space/ free disk space
- if machine is running it will create logs and they all gets stored -->so we need monitoring tools to monitor the space and notify us if 90% super space logs
- 5 principles of dev ops
	- monitoring
	- security- creating ssl certificates[open on https instead of http]
	- CI/CD
### Tools
### 1. linux-advanced
- [like httpd to check ports]  
- //lets say some service start running but its port is not open so we have to find which port it is working on- if not in UI it will be reloading too long 
### 2. cloud AWS[inbound rule SG]
### 3. Jenkins [CI/CD pipeline] 
- //if developer change the code a little bit we want to deploy that change ASAP so here comes the jenkins 
- its logo is waiter waiting to create a build
- we create jobs and schedule the job timings
- it has maven cmd, shell cmds and plugins
- after commit in git -->fetch and job-->createa job sequence
### Docker 
- an organization
- lets say application works fine in our lap [we installed all dependencies] it will not work as same in other pc 
- so we will send the image  [application + os]of the applicarton
### Kubernetes
- it is used for managing containers
### monitoring tools
- grafana
- prometheus
### Ansible- done
- Configuration management tool
- Playbook
- identical tools[sheff, puppet]
### Terraform

### GIT

### Resources
- cloud champ - linux cmds

### shell scripting advanced files daily basis
[do it]

### how to get logs from docker container to cloud watch
[do it]
- in company there are different teams
	- devops working on ui/ux team
	- pre production
	- production etc.....
### encrypt a docker image with python code


i m working in esika infitech remote position parttime
i have exp on ci tools jenkins
scm github
maven build tool
linux os
apache tomcat webservers and aws
for deploy i have used the aws code deploy

responsibilities
	any new project from scratch i will design and create jobs in jenkins 
	for existing proj i have supporting forthet
	for some client requirements i have configures sonar qube and 

from installing jenkins
before 3 month we have procured a new linux server i installed java, jenkins


maven build life cycle
	mvn clean install 
		it will clean the prev build [target folder and do install]
### Scenario-1
- #### create a docker container to run selenium test cases
ubuntu os 
java 
- install firefox [see you tube video]

### Scenario-2
- #### Upload all the files and directories in a drive older than a day to AWS and delete them from the drive.
How do I write a script?

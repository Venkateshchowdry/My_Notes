- running automate scripts to check the disk space/ free disk space
- if machine is running it will create logs and they all gets stored -->so we need monitoring tools to monitor the space and notify us if 90% super space logs
- 5 principles of dev ops
	- monitoring
	- security- creating ssl certificates[open on https instead of http]
	- CI/CD
### Tools
### 1. linux-advanced
- [like httpd to check ports]  
- //lets say some service start running but its port is not open so we have to find which port it is working on- if not in UI it will be reloading too long 
### 2. cloud AWS[inbound rule SG]
### 3. Jenkins [CI/CD pipeline] 
- //if developer change the code a little bit we want to deploy that change ASAP so here comes the jenkins 
- its logo is waiter waiting to create a build
- we create jobs and schedule the job timings
- it has maven cmd, shell cmds and plugins
- after commit in git -->fetch and job-->createa job sequence
### Docker 
- an organization
- lets say application works fine in our lap [we installed all dependencies] it will not work as same in other pc 
- so we will send the image  [application + os]of the applicarton
### Kubernetes
- it is used for managing containers
### monitoring tools
- grafana
- prometheus
### Ansible- done
- Configuration management tool
- Playbook
- identical tools[sheff, puppet]
### Terraform

### GIT

### Resources
- cloud champ - linux cmds

### shell scripting advanced files daily basis

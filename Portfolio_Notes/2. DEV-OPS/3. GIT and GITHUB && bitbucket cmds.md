- GIT is a version control tool[save changes with time stamp ]
- -->git --version
- in linux git is pre installed
- GITHUB is a repository
- -->git init 
	- [ to initialize version control of the folder-->go to the particular folder and type this command in terminal]
- Initialized empty Git repository in C:/Users/O Sandhya/Documents/git_demo/.git/[we will see this cmd but not .git/ file inside the folder]
- add that folder to workspace in VS CODE

## GIT 
- -->D: [to change directory]
- -->git --help
- -->git status
- //will display where you are like // we have to use this cmd inside the git repository
	- master branch
	- how many  commits we have made
	- untracked files 
- -->git checkout -b subbranch [here subbranch is the name of the subbranch]
- -->[-b] in above cmd is only used when we are creating a new branch
- ![[Pasted image 20221101165553.png]]
- // now we are on the sub branch [with the same code that was on master branch] // main code will not get affected and we can 
- -->git checkout master [switching back to master branch]
### Adding untracked files to the git
- -->git add [file name] //it will add files/ add changes we have done- means turn green -[staged]
- ![[Pasted image 20221101171508.png]]
- -->git commit -m "added venkat py code" 
	- [tracked]
	- [we have to write a msg for our reference to track changes] // then check status -->we will see working tree clean
	- if we dont commit we cannot restore to previous versions
	- [now after commit if we change any thing in the code and save -->if we check the git status it will show that u have done some modifications on the master branch]
- -->git restore [file name]
	- //if we accidentally delete the file also but git dont delete-->once we do git status it will display it and we can restore it with this cmd
- -->git add . 
	- [to add all untracked files but not recommended since chances of problem for developers not for devops]
- -->git restore --staged [file name] 
	- //it will unstage the file that is added to the git
- -->git log [stores every info regarding changes]
- -->git revert [commit id to which stage we want to revet]
	- // u find commit id in git log
	- even if we delete the file in the folder we have to do -->git add [file name ] to nofity git that we did make change-->and also have to do the-->git commit -m "message " to commit it
- -->git branch
	- to see in which branch you are in 
	- [branches are like versions of application] unless you notift the master branch about he changes in the branches it will not know

## GIT HUB
- - -->create repository in Git Hub
- -->clone -->copy url of https
	- now go to location of folder[in terminal] where you want to clone the github repo code // dont do git inin
- -->git clone [paste the url of github repo]
	- -->cd [repo name] then check git status
	- we can make any add and commit in local system[branch now since main is github]
- -->git clone -b [specific branch name]  [https path of the repository]
	- clone only a single branch of the repository
	
- -->git clone --single branch -b [react-mini]   [path of the repository]
	- react-mini name of the branch we are cloning
	- [it didnt work to clone th particular branch but research about it]
- -->git push [BellyWorks main]
	- it will push changes from local to github
	- // generally it is origin/main but we uses space here [research]
	- it will ask for password 
	- origin/main - git repo folders
	- if you do it again it will check whether is it up to date or not
- -->git pull [BellyWorks main]
	- it will fetch changes in git hub to local 
- -->if we dont have push permission we can fork at that time
- -->fork

## Bit bucket
- -->create repository in bit bucket
- -->clone -->copy url of https
- go to local folder where you save your code [inside of the folder]
- -->right click-->git bash
- -->git init
- -->git status
- if untracked files are there -->git add . [add all]
- -->git status [we see all files inside the folder green]
- -->git commit -m "add file"  [ you will see the create mode of every file]
- -->git status [ working tree clean] -->/every thing is comitted in local repository
- -->ctrl+l [clear the screen]
- -->git remote add bitbucket https://Venkateshchowdaryabhiram@bitbucket.org/venkateshchowdaryabhiram/workgenie.git //it will add reference from local repository to bit bucket repository
- -->git push -u -f bitbucket master   // to upload the code
- -->git pull [if u want to sync cloud with your local system]

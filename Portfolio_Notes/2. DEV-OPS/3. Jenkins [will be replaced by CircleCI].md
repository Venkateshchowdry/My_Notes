- jenkins is a tool used for automation
	- scripts automate
	- docker files automate
	- create cicd pipelines[getting code from github, build docker image, and push into server] and [can automate eaverything]
- 
- There are multiple ways to install jenkins
### 1. Manual Installation
- Jenkins server installation on ubuntu
- -->on ubuntu server
- -->sudo apt update [update our system]
- -->sudo apt install openjdk-11-jre [install java - java is a dependency]
- -->java --version [validate installation]
- -->curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io.key | sudo tee \
  /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null
echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
  - [copy cmd from google]
  - -->sudo apt-get update
  - -->sudo apt-get install jenkins
  - -->jenkins --version
  - -->done
### Start Jenkins
- -->sudo systemctl enable jenkins
	- systemctl-->is a cmd that is responsible for start, status, stop of any services in linux[research more]
- -->sudo systemctl start jenkins 
- -->sudo systemctl status jenkins
	- actively running
- -->ctrl + c [exit]
- [jenkins will run on port 8080]
### access jenkins from browser
- so enable custom tcp port 8080 in SG  of the server[source anywhere] and save
- now copy server public ip and paste it in browser[ip:8080]
- -->done success[accessed through browser]
- to unlock the jenkins we need a password
	- copy the path in the webpage and go to server
	- -->sudo cat [path]
	- -->copy the password and paste it in the browser
- jenkins will run on plugins[git plugin, docker plugin, source control plugin, bash plugin]
### Install suggested plugins
- -->create first admin user
	- -->username : Dev-Venkatesh[always write the position name along with name]
	- -->pswd: 
	- -->confirm pswd: 
	- -->full name:
	- -->email: [enter all these details]
	- -->save and finish
	- -->done
- now we can use jenkins successfully
- -->sudo systemctl stop jenkins [stopping jenkins]
- -->sudo systemctl status jenkins 

### 2. installing jenkins using docker[Automation]
- go to server we can install only one jenkins so stop it if you already have it
- -->docker
- -->sudo systemctl status jenkins[make sure you dont have jenkins on server]]
- -->sudo docker pull jenkins/jenkins [it will automatically install jenkins]
	- jenkins/jenkins [docker image name]
### jenkins running on container
- -->sudo docker ps
- -->sudo docker run -d -p 8001:8001 [docker image id]
- -->[docker.io/jenkins/jenkins:latest]
	- docker image id of jenkins -->available at the end after installation
- -->sudo docker run -d -p 8080:8080 docker.io/jenkins/jenkins:latest
	- jenkins running in deamon mode
### Docker cmds
- -->sudo docker kill [container id]
	- if docker image is not working or something happened
- -->sudo docker rm [container id]
- [refresh the browser your jenkins is running-->success]

### 3. Industry Std
- Install jenkins servers in ASG Config file in EC2-Ubuntu


### Integrate Jenkins with GIT HUB
- after developer push code in to git repo
- we will create jobs[pull the code and build process] in jenkins to build the code and deploy[we name them as jobs]
- even if we dont integrate github with jenkins it will woek 
	- but integration makes it smooth
- There are different options on how to run a job
	- 1. Manual
	- 2. Trigger Builds remotly
	- 3. Build after other projects are build
	- 4. Build periodically [say every 5 min]
	- 5. Poll SCM 
		- // lets say we set it for every 5 min then it will check the integrated git url every 5 min whether any new commits are done by developer or not. if new commit is there then it will run the job.
	- 6. GIT HUB Hook Trigger for GITscm polling
		- -// automatic trigger whenever developer commit the code[most used on in the job]
- [we can only use option 5 and 6 only when the jenkins server is integrated with the GIT HUB]
- our jenkins server is on aws and we have a 
### Integration
- to integrate we need jenkin server ip address, port number and token

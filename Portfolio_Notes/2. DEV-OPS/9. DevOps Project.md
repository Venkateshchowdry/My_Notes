### Project 2
Serverless architecture
- to add user / delete user we have to CRED[create read update delete] operations 
- when developer creating applications they cannot be able to scale the application[means in production] so devops engineer will use lambda functions and integrate with API Gateway then they are able to scale the application to millions of users[example are zomato or any app] 
- search api in train with subham channel

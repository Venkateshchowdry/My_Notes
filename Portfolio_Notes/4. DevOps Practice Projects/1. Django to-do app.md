### Test on local system
- -->VS Code
- -->open integrated terminal of the project folder
- --> git clone https://github.com/shreys7/django-todo.git
	- //clone from github
- //now we have to run the code so create a virtual environment[since we have to work with different python version and many more dependencies]
### Create virtual environment in windows
- -->pip install virtualenv
- -->python -m virtualenv myenv
	- [myenv] is the name of the environment
	- creating virtual env
- -->-cd venv
		-cd Scripts
		-activate.bat
	// run all the three cmds
- [but still some error]
- -->preferences-->settings-->search venv-->copy the path upto activate.bat file in the myenv and paste it here[replace \ with \\ in whole path except the first \ after the directory]
	- now close the terminal and program and open again
	- but still shows some windows permission error so paste the below cmd in the terminal
- -->Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
- -->done [now we are in the virtual environment]
- -->pip install django [we get a error so we installed]
- -->python manage.py makemigrations [from now on read me file cmds]
- -->python manage.py migrate [read me]
- -->python manage.py createsuperuser[read me]
- -->given my name: venkatesh
- -->mail : venkateshchowdary1@outlook.com
- -->pswd
- -->again pswd
- -->done
- -->python manage.py runserver
- // now server is running-->it will display the local host ip address-->click it you will see the app running
- -->ctrl+c [to stop the server]
- -->pip freeze > requirements.txt 
	- we have to add the extra requirements which we did during the running of the app like django installation step is not there in the read me
	- this cmd will automatically create the requirements here
- -->git checkout -b feature/deploy-app
	- creating a new branch of the previous code 
- -->git add .
- -->git commit -m "added requirements"
- -->git status
- -->git push [path of the repository where you want to push the new branch code]

## Run the app on EC2 Server
- -->create a ubuntu server[this is our private serrver]  [it is accessed by our vpn]
- -->ssh ubuntu@[public ip] -i abhiram.pem
- -->mkdir projects
- -->cd projects/
- -->git clone [path of the git repo]
- -->cd django-todo/
- -->sudo apt-get update
	- //update the system
- -->sudo pip3 install django 
	- // if pip3 is not installed install pip3
- -->sudo apt install python3-pip
- -->pip3 install django
- [now follow the read me notes] //above all are dependencies
